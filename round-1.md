# Round 1 - Planetfall

Summary
---

Strange activity has been detected in the Granjtann sector attracting attention from fleets in nearby quadrants.

The sectors positioning, and the relatively calm warp activity in the surrouding quadrant mean that activity has been noticed from very far away, and by a wide variety of interested parties.

Each have deployed investigative forces to the 5th planet from the sectors star, known as Slohper. Some to eradicate what they assume to be some great evil, others to claim or exploit it to their own ends.

It is currently unclear what the signal is, or _where_ exactly it is eminating from, however, as the scouting forces from nearby fleets land to investigate, skirmishes will be inevitable...
