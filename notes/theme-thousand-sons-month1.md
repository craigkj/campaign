As he sat, calmly and serenely, his hours long meditation coming to an end, a bright spark startled Sorceror Landus Dohw and almost caused him to lose his grip on his warp travel, throwing his focus into disarray. "What. Was. That" he muttered as he awoke back in his mortal body, the words as dry as ash, and containing a zealous fury.

He looked to his left, the scanners on his ship, the Vulv-Oh had picked up a faint signal originating from the same location, however it was by their standards unremarkable as they detected a thousand examples of such activity in minutes sometimes.

Landus knew this was different though. This was no mere fluctuation in the warp, distant explosion, or long wave radio signal. No, this was something else altogether. 

He would claim it, and the knowledge he was sure it would reveal, and pass that knowledge to his master, showing him his strength and dedication to his cause.

The mission he had been sent on - to disrupt the activities of an imperial fleet approaching worlds that were quitely in Tzeenche thrall, could wait. What were the lives of a few of tzeentches mortal minions compared to any promise of new knowledge, after all.

Yes, this was much more important. Whatever it was, Landus would have it.
