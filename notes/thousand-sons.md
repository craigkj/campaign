# The Scions of B'Faen

**Faction**: Thousand Sons (Chaos) - Cult of Duplicity

**Lore**:

As he sat, calmly and serenely, his hours long meditation coming slowly to an end, a bright spark startled Exaulted Sorceror Qi'Th and almost caused him to lose his grip on his warp travels, throwing his focus into disarray. "What. Was. That" he muttered as he awoke, flung back in his mortal body. The words as dry as ash, barely containing a zealous fury that had come from nowhere.

He looked to his left, though his psychic presence told him what he would see faster than the muscles in his neck could react. Ship scanners the had picked up a faint signal originating from the same location. It was by their standards unremarkable as such fluctuations were detected many times per hour as distant stars died or the warp flexed, however Qi'Th knew this was different. This was no mere fluctuation, distant explosion, or long wave radio signal. No, this was something else altogether. It was the sound of knowledge calling out to be discovered, to be understood, and to be assimilated into the library of Magnus. What a sweet song it was.

Qi'Th would claim it. There was no greater mission for the sons of Magnus than the pursuit of knowledge. Knowledge would give them power, and with power they would reign supreme over all.

His existing mission to disrupt the activities of an imperial fleet approaching worlds that were quietly in Tzeench's thrall could wait. What were the lives of a few mortal minions compared to any promise of new knowledge, after all.

Kra'on his second in command read his thoughts - those that Qi'Th chose to make available on at least - and began the process of waking his daemon engines ready for descent. They would be useful here, they always were.

Yes, this discovery was much more important. Whatever it was, Qi'th would have it.
