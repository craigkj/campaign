# Welcome!

Below is the *draft* ruleset for the eagerly anticipated Crusade campaign 2022!

The name of the campaign is currently TBC. Ideas Welcome.

Each round I'll draft some campaign story to set the scene. Each rounds story will be based on the events of the previous round as much as possible.

The campaign story:

- [Round 1 - Planetfall](/month-1.md)

Initially each round will last for 1 calendar month, starting in April. This may change depending on how things progress.

## Rules

For this campaign, the following rules in use:

- Core Rulebook
- Faction specific rules from specific codex (e.g. Codex Necrons)

At some point in the campaign we may add in one of the GW Crusade mission packs, depending on whether we think its useful.

However, the following rules changes are in place.

- **1) Points instead of power level**

When selecting "Orders of Battle" and mustering armies we will use points instead of power level.

Where PL is mentioned in the crusade rules the exchange rate is 1PL = 20points.

- **2) the Requisition "Increase Supply Limit" is not in use.**

Instead escalation of forces will be done in the following way:

| Round  | Order of Battle Limit | Game Size |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | 1000  | 500 |
| 2  | 1150  | 650 | 
| 3  | 1300  | 800 |
| 4  | 1500 | 1000 |
| 5+ | TBC | TBC |

- **3) Players start with 4 RP instead of 5, and the limit they can have is also 4 instead of 5**

This accounts of players not needing to spend RP points on the "Increase Supply Limit" requisition.

- **4) Traits/Scars/Bonus' determined randomly**

Whenever a battle trait, scar or faciton specific bonues _can_ be randomly determined, it must be*

To avoid particularly "feel bad" situations, each player will have two rerolls to use on the above, Use them wisely!

Additional rerolls can be purchased at a cost of 2 Requisition Points each.

**thematic exceptions can be made with a good explanation!*

How do I get started?
---

Firstly do two things:

- **1) Read the Rules!**

- **2) Pick a Faction!**

- **3) Write your Order of Battle!**

The starting Order of Battle limit is 1000 points, so before our first game we each need to submit an order of battle of at least 500, but up to 1000 points. You don't need to max out your order of battle at all times.

The first rounds games will be at 500 points (Combat Patrol) and we will gradually increase the game sizes. over time.

Order of Battle amendments can be done after each game as per the rules in the rulebook.

- **4) Thematic Additions**

As part of your Order of battle your Warlord also needs a suitably thematic name. **Any unnamed warlords will be named by me**. You have been warned.

I would also encourage you to name your "Order of Battle" thematically too, it is crusade after all... **Any unnamed Orders of Battle may also be named by me**. You have been warned.

- **5) Submit the above**

Before we start our first games, please write and submit to me:

1) Your Order of Battle
2) Your Warlords name
3) Your Order of Battle name
4) Your background story if you are feeling fancy

If you are using paper forms, a photo of them would be sufficient.

Playing Games
---

In some rounds the campaign may require the certain players face one another, include specialist scnearios, or even doubles games... Otherwise all players are free to organise games against others as they are available.

In the first round there are no "fixed" matches to be played.

**Only your first three games** of each round count for gaining experience, requisition points, campaign objectives and so on. 

*Obviously you can play as many additional games as you like, including against people who have not yet reached their cap of 3 games, however *you* wont gain campaign/crusade benefits for doing so. They can if they are within their 3 game limit.*

**Missions**

We will start by using the three Combat Patrol missions in the main rulebook (500 points games). 

*Remember: You are limited to using 500 points regardless of the size of your Order of Battle, however your army can vary game to game within your Order of Battle*

After that, we will play the following mission sets and game sizes:

| Round | Mission Set | Point Limit |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Combat Patrol  | 500 |
| 2  | Incursion  | 650  | 
| 3  | Incursion  | 800 |
| 4  | Incursion  | 1000 |
| 5+ | TBC | TBC |

The rulebook contains the rules for setting up the table and starting the game.

## After the Game

Please sumbit the results to me for recording

- Winner
- Player 1
  - Units that gained experience
  - Units that gained battle traits, scars, or other bonuses
- Player 2
  - Units that gained experience
  - Units that gained battle traits, scars, or other bonuses

**Please roll for traits and scars with your opponent at the end of the game.**

*Reminder: Between games you are free to make changes to your Order of Battle, spend RP, and so on as per the rules.*

Before your next battle, please make sure your Order of Battle is up to date and let me know of any changes you have made.

**Factions**

At the time of writing the factions are:

| Player  | Faction |
| --- | --- |
| Joel | Bad Mech (Chaos)* |
| Gareth | Eldar (Aeldari) |

## And Finally

Remember, this is a crusade campaign and not an elite competative event! Weird stuff may happen, ~~your~~ my general may turn into a chaos spawn. It should be fun!
