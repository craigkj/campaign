# Welcome!

Below is the *draft* ruleset for the eagerly anticipated Crusade campaign 2022!

The name of the campaign is currently TBC. Ideas Welcome.

Brief background to month one is here:

- [Month 1 - Planetfall](/month-1.md)

## Rules

For this campaign, the following rules in use:

- Core Rulebook
- Faction specific rules from specific codex (e.g. Codex Necrons)

At some point in the campaign we may add in one of the GW Crusade mission packs, depending on whether we think its useful.

There are two deviations from the above rules however:

1. Points instead of Power Level

When selecting "Orders of Battle" and mustering armies we will use points instead of power level.

Where PL is mentioned in the crusade rules the exchange rate is 1PL = 20points.

2. Traits/Scars/Bonus' determined randomly

Whenever a battle trait, scar or faciton specific bonues _can_ be randomly determined, it must be*

To avoid particularly "feel bad" situations, each player will have two rerolls to use on the above, Use them wisely!

Additional rerolls can be purchased at a cost of 2 Requisition Points each.

**thematic exceptions can be made with a good explanation!*

How do I get started
---

Firstly do two things:

1) **Read the Rules**
2) **Pick a Faction**
3) **Write your Order of Battle**

The starting Order of Battle limit is 1000 points, so before our first game we each need to submit an order of battle of at least 500, but up to 1000 points.

*Note that the first games will be at 500 points and we wont be playing games at 1000 points or above for a few months, so you only need to have 500 points ready to begin with. The 1000 point limit allows you to use a unit, get experience with it, and then leave it out of a game and bring it in later without losing the experience it gained.*

The first months games will be at 500 points (Combat Patrol) and we will gradually increase the game sizes. over time.

Order of Battle amendments can be done after each game as per the rules in the rulebook.

4) **Thematic Additions**

As part of your Order of battle your Warlord also needs a suitably thematic name. **Any unnamed warlords will be named by me**. You have been warned.

I would also encourage you to name your "Order of Battle" thematically too, it is crusade after all... **Any unnamed Orders of Battle may also be named by me**. You have been warned.

5) **Let me know the above**

Before game 1, please write and submit to me:

1) Your Order of Battle
2) Warlords name
3) Order of Battle name
4) Background Story if you are feeling fancy


Playing Games
---

Each month crusade games can be organised against any other player as we are available. 

In some months specific matches may be organised as appropriate as the campaign develops. There are not fixed opponents in month 1.

**Only the first three games** of each month count of gaining experience, requisition points, campaign objectives and so on. 

*Obviously you can play as many additional games as you like, including against people who have not yet reached their cap of 3 games, however *you* wont gain campaign/crusade benefits for doing so. They can if they are within their 3 game limit.*

**Missions**

We will start by using the three Combat Patrol missions in the main rulebook (500 points games). 

*Remember: You are limited to using 500 points regardless of the size of your Order of Battle, however your army can vary game to game within your Order of Battle*

After that, we will play the following mission sets and game sizes:

| Month  | Mission Set | Point Limit |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Combat Patrol  | 500 |
| 2  | Incursion  | 650  | 
| 3  | Incursion  | 800 |
| 4  | Incursion  | 1000 |
| 5+ | TBC | TBC |

The rulebook contains the rules for setting up the table and starting the game.

## After the Game

Please sumbit the results to me for recording

- Winner
- Player 1

Please roll for traits and scars with your opponent at the end of the game.

*Reminder: Between games you are free to make changes to your Order of Battle, spend RP, and so on as per the rules.*

Before your next battle, please make sure your Order of Battle is up to date and let me know of any changes you have made.
